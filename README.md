Almost compliant with
[the Tetris Guidline](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline).
T-spin recognition is nearly 3-corner T no kick, but will register on a triple.

The game has three play modes and goals as follows:

 * Marathon (score the most throughout the 15 levels)
 * Ultra (score the most in 3 minutes)
 * Sprint (clear 40 lines as fast as possible)

It is currently on development. You can find the source code at
